# Upgrad_Quora
In this project, we have worked on developing REST API endpoints of various functionalities required for a website (similar to Quora) from scratch. In order to observe the functionality of the endpoints, we used the Swagger user interface and store the data in the PostgreSQL database. Also, the project was implemented using Java Persistence API (JPA).
